	<!--I don't know if it's due to my smaller than average computer screen, but my site shows up without gaps on all pages using Chrome. 
		However, in Firefox and other browsers, the gaps appear like how they did in class for every browser.
		My site was designed with Chrome on my screen in mind (a bad idea, to be honest), so any suggestions for fixing that would be much appreciated.
		I'm honestly not sure how to maintain fluidity in the pages, especially regarding the side column's height, without gaps or making little edits with
			picture or map heights. Is there a CSS trick that will help with this that we'll learn later in class and the book?-->

						Ampersand was built on our founder's intense, almost perpetual craving for food of all kinds, especially when 
						some weren't available whenever she wanted them&mdash;a quality we're sure that everyone has had at one point in 
						their lives. Here, you can get any of our specialty dishes at any time of day as long as we're open in as many
						different ways as there are colors of the rainbow! 
						<br /><br />
						We strive to provide our diners with the highest quality foods & beverages with the quickest speed & service
						plus the greatest hospitality & service possible! The customer is always right, & we will do our best to treat 
						you like royalty.
